# firstApp

First time using AngularJS to make a web app. I used the Bitmake Lab Yeomen generator to get start. The generator allows me to use Sass, Bourbon, Neat, jQuery, and Grunt, but as it turned out this generator is not the right tool for the job, this generator can not compile my js file correctly. I cannot deploy my app with this generator unfortunately.

In this app, I built a app for a luxury watch store, most of the details of the products were made up. I explored some of the core functions of Angular while building this app, directives, filters and controllers. At this point of my studying, I have not learned how to use ngRoute and pull real data from an API. 

While I was building this app, I did not pay too much attention to organize my data, since I did not know how to it at the time. In the end, the app.js file become too much to organize. Also, I was following the developing strategy of developing with jQuery , I run into a lot trouble with this. In the end I learned that with framework like Angular, I need a different way of thinking about developing, structures are very important.

All in all, this was not a very successful project since there are so many future I do not know how to build and I cannot deploy it. However, I learned a lot of lessons here.
